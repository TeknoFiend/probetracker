== Probe Tracker

The idea behind this project is to provide a simple way to visualize where all the current NASA space probes are and be able to see each of their trajectories through time.

So far all I've built is an inaccurate model of the orbits of the planets. The data for the orbits is accurate but the animations assume circuluar orbits, don't have correct starting points, and don't account for inter-body perturbations.

My next big goal is to find out exactly how wrong the modeling is and whether the differences in orbital position over time will affect whether, for instance, a probe that went to Saturn actually intercepts Saturn.

I was assuming that I would be able to model the larger perturbations and change to elliptical orbits to model the orbits closely enough for the scales I care about but this may not work out.

If anyone has experience in orbital/celestial mechanics I would love some help!
